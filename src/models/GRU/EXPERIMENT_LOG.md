# TES GRU Surrogate — Experiment Log

Lab notebook for the GRU input-feature ablation pipeline
(`GRU_input_ablation.py` → `tes_gru/` package). Newest entries on top.

**Conventions**
- One dated entry per change or run. Record *what* changed, *why*, the config
  delta, the expected effect, and (later) the observed result.
- Status tags: `[CODE]` landed in source, not yet run · `[RUNNING]` ·
  `[DONE]` results in hand · `[SUPERSEDED]`.
- Each sweep writes to `runs/<RUN_NAME_BASE>_seed<N>/`. Keep the `RUN_NAME_BASE`
  here in sync with `config.py` so the log maps 1:1 to output folders.

| `RUN_NAME_BASE` | pad mode | variants × seeds | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `2026-05-25_8var_1200ep_P0_seqsliding` | `zero` | 8 × 4 = 32 runs | `[DONE]` ~116 GPU-h (rejected baseline) |
| `2026-06-28_abs_sliding_1200ep_P0_init` | `init` | `abs_sliding` × 4 = 4 | `[CODE]` pending |
| `2026-06-28_abs_sliding_1200ep_P0_variable` | `variable` | `abs_sliding` × 4 = 4 | `[CODE]` pending |

The open question (report Future Work) is which `t=0` fix wins on the **forward
sliding variant** (`abs_sliding`): **`init`** — pad the pre-history with the `t=0`
steady-state value (Yiming's suggestion at the final review) — vs **`variable`** —
a variable-length window feeding only the real steps (the presenter's proposal;
the report's "cleanest fix"). The old **`zero`** padding was rejected at that
review (it caused the ~9 °C `t=0` undershoot); its data already exists
(`2026-05-25`), so it is the fixed baseline, **not re-run**. Both new sweeps use
the full seed set `{7, 21, 42, 123}`; every non-sliding variant is untouched, so
its `2026-05-25` numbers still stand.

Shared protocol (unchanged across the entries below): stacked GRU
`hidden=128, layers=5, dropout=0.3`, `lr=0.0025`, `batch=16`, `1200` epochs,
best-val checkpoint; P0 stability provisions (grad-clip `1.0`, orthogonal
recurrent init, `60`-epoch LR warmup); learned `InitStateEncoder` (h0);
teacher forcing `0.5 → 0` over `100` epochs; `WINDOW_SIZE=10`; seeds
`{7, 21, 42, 123}`; 8 variants (forward + inverse × delta/abs/abs+delta/sliding).

### Change B — Refactor: monolith → `tes_gru/` package `[CODE]`

`GRU_input_ablation.py` (2957 lines) split into a package; the file is now a
thin launcher. **Run command is unchanged: `python GRU_input_ablation.py`.**

| module | role |
|---|---|
| `config.py` | all run constants + setup primitives (`set_seed`, `DEVICE`, schedules, `BASE_DIR`) |
| `utils.py` | `format_duration`, `_to_jsonable` |
| `models.py` | encoders, `ThermalGRU`, loss |
| `data.py` | `ThermalDataset`, loader / manual split |
| `rollout.py` | variant rollouts (incl. the padding logic changed in Change A) |
| `train.py` | `train_model` |
| `evaluate.py` | `test_model`, metrics, per-case plots |
| `runio.py` | run dir layout, checkpoint / resume / meta / history I/O |
| `main.py` | `main()` — sweep seeds × variants, comparison figures |

Two refactor-specific fixes (would otherwise break silently):
- **`BASE_DIR`**: path anchoring moved from `os.path.dirname(__file__)` to a
  `config.BASE_DIR` that points at `src/`, so `runs/` and the relative
  data-root candidates resolve the same as before despite living one dir deeper.
- **`RUN_NAME` live ref**: the only runtime-mutated global. `runio`/`main` use
  `config.RUN_NAME` (live) instead of an `import *` snapshot.

**Verification**
- All modules compile; `import tes_gru.main` resolves all relative imports.
- AST audit: 31/31 module-level globals preserved with byte-identical values
  (30 in `config.py`, `_DEFAULT_WEIGHTS` in `models.py`); 0 removed, 0 `global`
  statements; only `BASE_DIR` added; only `RUN_NAME` is runtime-mutable.
- Numerical equivalence vs the pre-split monolith (identical weights, same
  random inputs): forward `_rollout_sliding`, inverse `_rollout_inverse`,
  `ThermalGRU` forward, `_r2`, `_mape` all **maxdiff = 0.0**.
- Adversarial 4-dimension review (line coverage · name resolution · deliberate
  edits · extended equivalence): all PASS. Extended pass covered all 8 variants'
  feature engineering, `run_rollout_train` (incl. seeded teacher-forcing + dropout
  RNG order), gradients, and the schedules — 143 comparisons, all maxdiff 0.
  Three names resolving only via transitive `import *` (`time`/`np`/`random`) were
  hardened to explicit imports.

No behavioral change intended; this entry exists for reproducibility provenance.

### Change A — Sliding-window `t=0` padding fix: `zero` → {`init`, `variable`} `[CODE]`

**What.** `SLIDING_PAD_MODE` now selects among three ways to handle the missing
`W-1-t` window positions at rollout step `t < W-1`:
- **`variable`** — no padding: feed only the `t+1` real steps (a variable-length
  window). At `t=0` it degenerates to a single real step, identical to `abs`, so
  the `InitStateEncoder`'s clean `h0` is used uncorrupted; the window grows to `W`
  as `t` advances. *(The presenter's proposal; the report's "cleanest fix".)*
- **`init`** *(default)* — repeat the `t=0` steady-state row. *(Yiming's fix.)*
- **`zero`** — legacy zero-pad. *(Rejected baseline.)*

Applied at all four touchpoints (`_rollout_sliding`, `_rollout_inverse`, and the
two single-case mirrors in `test_model`). The mode is **overridable via the
`SLIDING_PAD_MODE` env var**, and `RUN_NAME_BASE` folds it in, so one launch
script can sweep both fixes without editing `config.py`.

**Why.** Inputs are MinMax-scaled to `[0,1]`, so a zero pad equals the *coldest*
temperature (~100 °C). Zero-padding injected a spurious "cold-system" signal at
the start of every rollout, dragging the clean `h0` cold and producing the ~9 °C
`t=0` undershoot seen across most cases in `2026-05-25`. At the final project
review **Yiming** rejected zero-padding and proposed padding with the initial
steady-state value (`init`); the presenter had proposed a variable-length window
(`variable`). Both are in the report Future Work; this round measures **both**
against the existing `zero` baseline. (Arnold was absent from that review.)

**Config delta.**
- `SLIDING_PAD_MODE`: three modes; env-overridable; default `init`.
- `RUN_NAME_BASE = f"2026-06-28_abs_sliding_1200ep_P0_{SLIDING_PAD_MODE}"` — folds
  the mode into the run dir (`..._init` / `..._variable`); no stale-cache reuse.
- `VARIANTS = ['abs_sliding']`; seeds `[7, 21, 42, 123]`.
- mode recorded in `run_config.json` / aggregate meta / startup banner.

**How to run both** (one process per mode; PowerShell):
```
$env:SLIDING_PAD_MODE="init";     python GRU_input_ablation.py   # -> ..._init_seedN
$env:SLIDING_PAD_MODE="variable"; python GRU_input_ablation.py   # -> ..._variable_seedN
```
Each invocation reads the env var once at import. `zero` reproduces `2026-05-25`.

**Expected effect (to confirm).** Both `init` and `variable` should largely remove
the `t=0` undershoot; `variable` is the cleaner fix (h0 untouched at the start).
Marginal overall-MAE change; variant ranking unchanged. Baseline —
`zero`-pad `abs_sliding`: overall MAE `1.93 ± 0.25 °C`, `R² = 0.995`, 4/4 seeds.

**Verification (code-level).**
- `init` mode is byte-identical to the pre-split monolith (maxdiff 0) — the new
  `variable` branch is inert there.
- `variable`: window lengths grow `1,2,…,W` then plateau at `W` (`t=0` = single
  step); train-time (batch) and test-time (single-case) rollouts agree exactly
  (maxdiff 0). Bad `SLIDING_PAD_MODE` fails fast (assert).

### Next steps
1. Run both sweeps — `init` and `variable`, `abs_sliding` × 4 seeds each. `[ ]`
2. Compare `init` vs `variable` (and both vs the existing `zero` baseline): `t=0`
   undershoot, early/late-window MAE, overall MAE, per-seed spread. Pick the
   winner; update this entry to `[DONE]` with numbers. `[ ]`
3. Window-size sweep `W ∈ {5, 10, 20, 40}` under the hardened protocol — window
   size is the expected primary lever for further gains (raised by Yiming at the
   review). `[ ]`
